Description: syntax highlighting package written in Python
 Pygments aims to be a generic syntax highlighter for general use in all kinds
 of software such as forum systems, wikis or other applications that need to
 prettify source code.
 .
 Highlights are:
   * a wide range of common languages and markup formats is supported
   * special attention is paid to details, increasing quality by a fair amount
   * support for new languages and formats are added easily
   * a number of output formats, presently HTML, LaTeX and ANSI sequences
   * it is usable as a command-line tool and as a library
   * ... and it highlights even Brainfuck!
